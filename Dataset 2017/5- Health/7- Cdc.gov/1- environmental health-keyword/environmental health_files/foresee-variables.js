//  A mapping class used to define a mapping from a URL (or URL fragment) to a set of FSR parameters.


//  Sampling percentage (sp) value example: "1" would equal 1%
//  Loyalty factor (lf) is a page view count (# of times a page must be viewed before displaying survey)
//  The "exact" flag allows you to use regular expressions when specifying the URL in the mapping
